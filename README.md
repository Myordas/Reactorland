The capital of the nation is Victoria and the home of the largest telecommunication tower in the entire wasteland, the Reactor Tower, officially known as the Moonflower Tower.

 -The Reactorians:
-----
The neomodern Reactorians are descendants of the ancient FBE Reactor culture located nearby Burbank (Reactorian city of Izzi-Sharonia), this multiracial culture is what leads to the creation of the Reactorian culture of philosophical viewing. The Reactorland ethnic lands consists of hundreds of tribes (204 to be exact) with different cultures, customs, traditions and philosophies. Every Reactorian tribe has different gods to worship with (for example, the capital city of Victoria worship a god namesake to that city which is a god of happiness, Bradonii worships Brandon, the god of privacy, Liaia worships god Lia as god of fame, etc). The physical appearance of neomodern White Reactorians are similar to Americans with light brown skin tone and mostly brown eyes but with facial features similar to a mix of Latin Americans and Armenians but neomodern black people of Reactorland remained unchanged in both facial and physical features from their ancient Black American descendants.

------
Reactorland culture is a very diverse comparable to our modern Japanese culture (but without the weirdness), anyone in the wasteland knows that Reactorland is famous for their reaction video culture which features different people all around wasteland and their reactions and philosophies but Reactorland is not just famous in their most famous export but there's more such as their neomodern forests, unique Humanist sacred sites, cheap schools and RV camps with free things
