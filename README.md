Overview of Reactorland:

 -Introduction:
Reactorland is a nation located in West Coast of North America. Better known as "Tribal States of Reactorland" this nation has a population of 31,000,000 in the year 3025. The capital of the nation is Victoria and the home of the largest telecommunication tower in the entire wasteland, the Reactor Tower, officially known as the Moonflower Tower.

 -The Reactorians
The modern Reactorians are descendants of the ancient FBE Reactor culture located nearby Burbank (Reactorian city of Izzi-Sharonia), this multiracial culture is what leads to the creation of the Reactorian culture of philosophical viewing. The Reactorland ethnic lands consists of hundreds of tribes (204 to be exact) with different cultures, customs, traditions and philosophies. Every Reactorian tribe has different gods to worship with (for example, the capital city of Victoria worship a god namesake to that city which is a god of happiness, Bradonii worships Brandon, the god of privacy, Liaia worships god Lia as god of fame, etc). The physical appearance of modern White Reactorians are similar to Americans with light brown skin tone and mostly brown eyes but with facial features similar to a mix of Latin Americans and Armenians but modern black people of Reactorland remained unchanged in both facial and physical features from their ancient Black American descendants.
